      <h1>Helping Our Planet</h1>
      <section>
        <p>One thing I'm super passionate about is the environment and helping to mitigate
            climate change. </p>
        <p>Below are just a few lifestyle changes I have made, and that 
            anyone can make, to be more sustainable! (Hover over the images to learn more :))
        </p>

            <div class="vegan"><b>Eat plant-based.</b> Going vegan, or just reducing meat, dairy, and egg
                    consumption, is one of the greatest ways an individual can reduce
                    their carbon footprint! 
            </div>
            <img src="images/clothes.png"/>
            <div class="clothes"><b>Say no to fast fashion.</b> The fashion industry pollutes the ocean
                with microplastics, uses copious amounts of water, and adds to carbon pollution.
                Try buying second-hand or purchasing from sustainable companies!

            <div class="plastic"><b>Don't use single-use plastic.</b> A simple change like using a 
                reusable water bottle or taking reusable bags to the grocery store can make 
                a big difference!
