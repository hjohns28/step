      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p>My story begins in Sacramento, California, where I was
          born the youngest of three. I have a sister who is 8 years 
          older than me, and a brother who is 4 years older. My dad is
          a piano teacher, and my mom is a caricature artist. My 
          parents' occupations catered to a creative and busy household.
      </p>
      <p>Growing up, my siblings and I spent a lot of time drawing, playing
          music, running around, and learning math with our dad. Among 
          many odd tricks, I learned how to juggle, unicycle,
          solve the Rubik's cube, and throw a frisbee four different ways.
          As I grew up, I was taught to love learning, and I believe that that
          contributed to my love for computer science and engineering. Wanting
          to help shape the future involves constantly learning, and that's 
          something I always want to continue doing!
