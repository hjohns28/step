      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <section class="aboutmepage">
        <p>I'm originally from Sacramento, California, where I was
            born the youngest of three. I have an older sister and brother, both 
            engineers, while my dad is a piano teacher and my mom a caricature artist. 
            My parents' occupations catered to a creative and busy household.
        </p>
        <p>Growing up, my siblings and I spent a lot of time drawing, playing
            music, running around, and learning math with our dad. I played the 
            clarinet and saxophone in school, and the piano at home; I did swim
            team, basketball, volleyball, and track; and I learned many odd tricks
            with my dad, such as juggling, solving the Rubik's cube, and unicycling. 
            I loved constantly learning, which is probably why I also love computer
            science and engineering. When it comes to wanting to help shape the future, 
            we can always learn more. 
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I am a rising sophomore at Loyola Marymount University. I'm
            studying Civil Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. Although
            times are uncertain at the moment, I'm excited to see what the future holds!
